# Before we begin
- Tools and Features do not have to be installed on the same server for communication
- Personal preferences: 
- Certain bookmarks for certain browsers
- Setting up shared directories to avoid redundant filepaths (VS Code) and downloads
- e.g.- setting up default directories for saving or accessing files (or similar) in onedrive. Enterprise will use knowledge services such as Sharepoint for filesharing and real-time team colaboration
- clean up after install
- Organization is key!
